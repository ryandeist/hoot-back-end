# Hoot Back-End Setup

##
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code
```

## Cloning the Auth boilerplate
This lecture uses the [Express API JWT Auth Template](https://github.com/ryandeist/express-api-jwt-auth-template) as starter code. The template includes code to authenticate users with JWT tokens.

Navigate to the Express API JWT Auth Template and clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryandeist/express-api-jwt-auth-template.git
```

Once we have the repository on our machines, we can change the name of the directory to `'express-api-hoot-back-end'`:

```bash
mv express-api-jwt-auth-template express-api-hoot-back-end
```

Next, `cd` into your renamed directory:

```bash
cd express-api-hoot-back-end
```

Finally, remove the existing `.git` information from this template:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> Removing the `.git` info is important as this is just a starter template. You do not need the existing git history for this project.

## GitHub setup
To add this project to GitHub, initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
```

Make a new repository on GitHub named `express-api-hoot-back-end`.

Link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/express-api-hoot-back-end.git
git push origin main
```

> ðŸš¨ Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<github-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.

Open the projectâ€™s folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

## Install dependencies
Next, you will want to install all of the packages listed in `package.json`

```bash
npm i
```

## Create your .env
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
touch .env
```

Lastly, we want to add a `MONGODB_URI` and a `JWT_SECRET`.

Add the following secret keys to your application:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sei-w0kys.azure.mongodb.net/hoot?retryWrites=true
JWT_SECRET=supersecret
```

## Run the application
If you check the `package.json` of your starter code, youâ€™ll see a script has been added to run the application using the dev dependency `nodemon`.

Start the application with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Happy Coding!
