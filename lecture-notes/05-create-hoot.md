# Hoot Back-End - Create Hoot

## Overview
In this section, we will make a route to create a new hoot. This route will be a `POST` request to `/hoots`, and will return a JSON response with the new hoot document. The purpose of this route is to handle data that is sent along with a **form submission**.

We will be following these specs when building the route:
- CRUD Action: CREATE
- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/hoots`
- Response: JSON
- Success Status Code: `201` Created
- Success Response Body: A new hoot object
- Error Status Code: `500` Internal Server Error
- Error Response Body: A JSON object with an error key and a message describing the error

## Create a `hootsRouter`
Before we can start writing the route and controller function, we‚Äôll need to create a hootsRouter and mount it to `server.js`.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
touch controllers/hoots.js
```

Add the following boilerplate to `controllers/hoots.js`.

```js
// controllers/hoots.js

const express = require("express");
const verifyToken = require("../middleware/verify-token.js");
const Hoot = require("../models/hoot.js");
const router = express.Router();

// add routes here

module.exports = router;
```

In `server.js`, let's import the `hootsRouter` and add it to our `'/hoots'` route.

Add the following to `server.js`:

```js
// server.js

const hootsRouter = require("./controllers/hoots.js");
```

And mount the router:

```js
// server.js

app.use("/hoots", hootsRouter);
```

## Define the route
Next we'll define a route that listens for `POST` requests on `'/hoots'`:

```
POST /hoots
```

Add the following route to `controllers/hoots.js`:

```js
// controllers/hoots.js

router.post("/", verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  // new route
});
```
> üèÜ Adding verifyToken directly to this route guarantees its protection, independent of the order in which middleware is applied elsewhere in the application. This approach is the recommended method for handling authentication when securing routes individually.

> üí° In `server.js`, we set the base path for our `hootsRouter` as `/hoots`. This means that when defining the router above, we only need to specify the path as /. This path will automatically be appended to the base path /hoots defined in server.js.

## Code the Controller Function
Let's break down what we'll do inside the controller function step by step:

1. **Add the logged-in user as the author**

    Before creating a new `hoot`, we‚Äôll add the logged-in user‚Äôs ID (`req.user._id`) to the `req.body.author`. This ensures that the logged-in user is recorded as the author of the `hoot`.

2. **Create the hoot**

    We‚Äôll use the `create()` method from the `Hoot` model, passing in `req.body`. This method will create a new `hoot` document.

    - At first, the `author` property in this document will only have the user‚Äôs ID (an ObjectId).
    - To include the full user information, we‚Äôll add the complete `user` object (already available in `req`) to the new `hoot`.
    > üí° This step is important so that the new hoot can immediately display the author‚Äôs details on the client side.

3. **Send the response**
After creating the new `hoot`, we‚Äôll send it back as a JSON response. This way, the client can immediately show the new hoot with all its information.

Add the following to controllers/hoots.js:

```js
// controllers/hoots.js

router.post("/", verifyToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.body.author = req.user._id;
    const hoot = await Hoot.create(req.body);
    hoot._doc.author = req.user;
    res.status(201).json(hoot);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ err: err.message });
  }
});
```
> üí° When we use Mongoose‚Äôs `create()` method, the new `hoot` is not just a regular JavaScript object‚Äîit‚Äôs a **Mongoose document**. This document includes an extra `_doc` property, which holds the actual data retrieved from MongoDB. Normally, we don‚Äôt need to worry about this, but since we‚Äôre updating the `author` property before sending the response, we‚Äôll need to access the `hoot._doc` property to work with the actual data.

## Test the route in Postman
Now that we have finished the route let‚Äôs test it with Postman. We‚Äôll do this by sending a `POST` request to

```
http://localhost:3000/hoots
```

Recall that our `hootSchema`has the following data fields:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const hootSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    text: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    category: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: ["News", "Sports", "Games", "Movies", "Music", "Television"],
    },
    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" },
    comments: [commentSchema],
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

In Postman, make a new POST request called Create.

![create route](/public/images/create-hoot-request.png)
> ‚ùó Be sure to add this request to your Hoot collection.

Add the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/hoots
```

Since this request requires authentication, we‚Äôll need to give **Postman** access to our token from the previous step.

Select the **Authorization** tab, and make sure the **Type** is set to **Inherit auth from parent**.

![create hoot auth](/public/images/auth.png)

Within the Body tab, select raw, and change the Text dropdown to JSON. Next, add the following test data to the body:

```json
{
  "title": "Big News",
  "category": "News",
  "text": "hoot Text"
}
```

Your request in **Postman** should look something like this. Note the changed values highlighted below, and don‚Äôt forget to save:

![create hoot body](/public/images/request.png)

If your request was successful, you should see something like the response below:

![successful create hoot request](/public/images/response%20(1).png)
